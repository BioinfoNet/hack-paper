## Hack paper Writing Sprint

[Writing Sprint](https://medium.com/coffee-house-writers/writing-sprints-getting-words-to-paper-6c06fcf6e263) is a concept that allows a team to work together on a project in short sprints over a period to complete a project. An individual can also undertake a Sprint, or groups coming together but each focusing on their writing. The idea is to get words to paper at an agreed time. Each Sprint has a target. And mainly, our first Sprint will not be concerned with perfecting the writing or finishing the article, but putting all the information we need into the text. Working through the materials, we have previously generated and watch the theme or key message emerge. 

Remember it is a sprint. Take note and set aside any task that does not involve writing, especially if it takes more than 10 minutes. 

#### 3:00 - 3:15: Introduction and summary of tasks via Zoom
- Introducing the approach
- Sharing the tasks
- Some key pointers to writing fast


### 3:15 - 4:45: Focused Sprint by all the teams
- Each will focus on the assigned sections
- At this point, do not stress on writing perfect sentences but getting the information to the document
- Approach:
    - As you read through the reports, add key bullet points to the sections
    - From our reports, obtain any information that supports the message, and add to the document
    - Determine the evidence needed to support the central theme (A figure, a reference, a statistic)
    - At this point, set aside work that does not involve writing (Only indicate the required evidence)
    - Do not spend so much time editing for grammar; the aim is to get the points to the paper 
 
 
 ### 4:45 - 5:00: Recap and next steps
 - For each team, what have we achieved?
 - What is pending?
 - Is the approach working?
 - If we are to do it again, what should we change?
 - What did you learn from the experience?
 
 ### Post Sprint
 - Gather evidence and prepare for the next Sprint
 - Leads to adjust and prepare for the next round
 - Generate any Figure needed for each section
 
### Thank You!
