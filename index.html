<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >Open, collaborative and reproducible research &#8211; Open Science &#8211; has a great potential for
advancing science. However, the training in our local universities does not equip students with
the tools to practice open science. However, to work in the open and collaborate,
your collaborators should be equipped to use the tools that you use. The main
barrier to working open, therefore, is the lack of awareness of the collaboration tools
and the skills required to utilize these tools. Therefore, to fill the gap through an
open science community, funded by a Mozilla Mini-grant &#8211; OpenScienceKE, we
are promoting open science among bioinformatics students and researchers in the
Nairobi area by training using this model: sensitize, train, hack and collaborate. This
model first sensitizes on open science practices through seminars, trains on open
science tools through workshops, facilitates hands-on application of the tools through
hackathons, and finally fosters a community of open science enthusiasts through
meetups.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   OpenScienceKE sought to address the following problems: the lack of awareness of open
science practices and tools within the Bioinformatics community in Kenya; the poor adoption
of open science practices in Bioinformatics; and the absence of research to establish the state
of affairs in adopting open science in Kenya. From the OpenScienceKE hackathon, we
managed to create an open resource that the students could use to figure out where they can
cost-effectively publish open access. In addition, through literature search and data mining,
we observed a growing interest in open science practices in Kenya but the lack of
awareness and skills hinder the adoption. The use of preprints for research dissemination
haven&#8217;t caught up in Kenya; out of the 20,069 papers downloaded from bioRXiv, only
18 have Kenyan authors, a majority of which are as a result of international (16)
collaborations. We also observed a lack of incentives and policy in academic and research
institutions to support open science. The fear of being scooped and the competitive
spirit within the scientific community are also major barriers to working in the
open.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   The first iteration of the model which focused on academic institutions set the foundation
for next phase: promote the open and reproducible science in research institutions. This
model provides the framework for the adoption of open science practices within the

institution and others in the future. As genomic research data generated in Africa grows,
there is a need for the adoption of open science practices in data storage, reproducible
pipelines and collaborative research. We propose this approach, which develops the necessary
infrastructure within research institutions, and builds human capacity through the model:
sensitize, train, hack and collaborate. Promotion of open science in Africa recognizes the
future direction of research and OpenScienceKE is growing the culture and practice in the
research active region.

<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >This will be a data analysis section. The title of this section will depend on the results of your
analysis. For example, if Kenyan researchers are not publishing open access, we
will need to understand why that is the case. The solution may lie in the cost of
publishing, and that is how the resource created by Open Access options team is
useful.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   We address questions like: - What is the publishing trend by Kenyan researchers - Are
they publishing open access, and how has this changed over the years? - Are Kenyan
researchers embracing pre-prints (BioRXiv, AriRXiv, ResearchGate, F1000Research). Who is
driving the adoption of pre-prints? Local researchers or foreign collaborators? -
What are the collaboration trends? Are Kenyan researcher collaborating locally or
internationally?

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >The article processing charge is the main barrier to publishing open access, in addition to the
obsession with impact factors. However, for early career scientists and students, especially in
developing countries, most publishers offer waivers and subsidies but few are aware.
In this section, we explore some of the avenues to publishing open access at low
cost.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   To address this problem, we created a resource that can guide ECR and students on where
they publish open access, and at low cost. We also provide information on how
